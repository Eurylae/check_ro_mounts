# check_ro_mounts
Monitoring Plugin in Perl to check for read-only mounted file systems

This is a reboot of the check_ro_mounts.pl plugin written by Valentin Vidic back in 2008.

The plugin supports several inclusion (-p or -T) and exclusion (-x or -X) methods and also supports checking file systems discovered in /etc/fstab (-F).
